			     <h3> Blog Post One</h3>
				 <small> Psted by Anshika on June 5</small>
				 <p> Just imagine me, a 14-year-old girl with the power of teleportation, saving people’s lives. 
			    For me, that is a lot of pressure. I always had a fondness for superpowers and how they change
			    lives, and I know that the power of teleportation changed my life by helping me do more things
			    in less time. I use this superpower for my punctuality. Before I had this power, I would sleep
			    past my alarm and get up 10 minutes late, so I would have to rush when I got ready for school,
			    and I live about 20 minutes away, this would cause my dad to drive super fast which is unsafe
			    for us and the people around us. Now, I can wake up relaxed, not worry about getting late, and
			    dad driving too fast because I would teleport to my school within seconds. Another way this power
		    	changed my life is by fulfilling my dream of traveling to all the locations on my bucket list. 
			    Just imagine, going anywhere in the world, either far or close, within seconds rather than going
			    on a long hour flight with annoying crying babies or loud snoring, this power helps me and my
			    family travel a lot. Another result of this wonderful power is helping my community by saving
			    people from accidents, I really like helping people in general, but this power boosts my chances
			    of helping many people and giving back to the people I cherish the most. Due to my age, I am 
			    underestimated by a lot of grown-ups, this power helps me change their mentalities and change
			    stereotypes in the society that we live in today. With these effects, my persona changed from
			    timid to confident by me helping people and myself from all the daily tasks I have to deal with.
